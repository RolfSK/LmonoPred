MissingOutputException in rule parse_alignments in file /Users/algm/bin/LmonoPred/workflow/rules/align.smk, line 52:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/Users/algm/Benchmarking_paper_test/test_align/align_out/align_identities_out.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
